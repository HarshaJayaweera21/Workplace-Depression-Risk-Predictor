## 📌 Overview

This project presents a machine learning–based system to predict **workplace depression risk** using anonymized demographic, lifestyle, and work-related survey data. The primary objective is to identify employees who may be at risk of depression at an early stage, enabling **timely and proactive interventions**.

By leveraging supervised **binary classification**, the system analyzes factors such as:

- Work pressure  
- Job satisfaction  
- Sleep duration  
- Dietary habits  
- Financial stress  
- Work hours  
- Family mental health history  

The model outputs a **risk classification** along with a **probability score**, supporting ethical and informed decision-making to improve employee well-being.

## 🎯 Problem Motivation

Depression in the workplace often remains undetected until it significantly affects:

- Employee productivity  
- Absenteeism  
- Job performance  
- Staff turnover  

This project addresses a critical gap in **occupational health psychology** by providing a **data-driven and interpretable** solution for early risk detection. The system is designed for integration into **HR analytics platforms** or **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)**, with strong emphasis on:

- Ethical handling of sensitive data  
- Fairness and bias awareness  
- Practical deployment readiness  

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Target Variable:** Depression Risk (Yes / No)  

### Why Logistic Regression?

- High interpretability for healthcare-related use cases  
- Produces meaningful probability estimates  
- Lower risk of overfitting compared to complex models  
- Suitable for ethical and transparent decision support systems  

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing techniques are applied consistently during training and inference:

- Label Encoding for binary categorical features  
- Ordinal Encoding for ordered categorical variables  
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
- Unified preprocessing pipeline to ensure prediction consistency  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## ▶️ How to Run the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshaJayaweera21/Workplace-Depression-Risk-Predictor.git
cd Workplace-Depression-Risk-Predictor
```

### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)

Make sure [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed and running.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service  | URL                    |
|----------|------------------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost       |
| Backend  | http://localhost:8000  |

### Option B: Manual Setup

> ⚠️ **Before running manually**, update the following:
> - In `predictor-api/main.py`, add your frontend's dev server origin (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) to the `allow_origins` list.
> - Create a `predictor-ui/.env` file with: `VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`

#### 2️⃣ Run the Predictor API (FastAPI)

```bash
cd predictor-api
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate # On Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- Backend will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

#### 3️⃣ Run the Predictor UI (React)

```bash
cd predictor-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:5173

### ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

- This system **does not diagnose depression**  
- Predictions are **probabilistic** and intended for **early risk awareness only**  
- Designed to **support human decision-making**, not replace it  
- Emphasizes **fairness, transparency, and responsible use** of mental health data
